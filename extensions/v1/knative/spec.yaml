longDescription: |
  Knative (pronounced kay-nay-tiv) extends Kubernetes to provide a set of middleware components that are essential to build modern, source-centric, and container-based applications that can run anywhere: on premises, in the cloud, or even in a third-party data center.

  Each of the components under the Knative project attempt to identify common patterns and codify the best practices that are shared by successful, real-world, Kubernetes-based frameworks and applications. Knative components focus on solving mundane but difficult tasks such as:

  * Deploying a container
  * Routing and managing traffic with blue/green deployment
  * Scaling automatically and sizing workloads based on demand
  * Binding running services to eventing ecosystems
  * Developers on Knative can use familiar idioms, languages, and frameworks to deploy functions, applications, or containers workloads.

  > Warning: Knative installation will not work properly unless Istio is installed to the `istio-system` namespace.
